# Git repository for the operator learning course

The notebook containing the code of the project is the 'code_to_run.ipynb' notebook. The mixture document is a copy of the package OPERA that was supposed to be the adaptation of the package of the same name in R. The remaining docs are either tests or the beginning of the TD that are not useful for running the project.
